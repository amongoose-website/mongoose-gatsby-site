            been writing and studying the now-established environmental philosophy 
            of sustainable development. I was first confronted with it at the 
            United Nations Conference on Population and Development-UNCED in Cairo, 
            Egypt in 1994. Sustainable development was a core philosophy behind 
            the Programme of Action called "Agenda 21" at the 1992 United Nations 
            Conference on the Environment and Development-UNCED, now dubbed the 
            "Rio Earth Summit." </font>

              most effective programme of international action ever sanctioned 
              by the international community. It is not a final and complete action 
              programme, but one which must continue to evolve. </font></div>

          <p align="left"><span style="color:rgb(116,27,71)"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Sustainable development has continued 
            to evolve as that of protecting the world's resources while its true 
            agenda is to control the world's resources. Communism also has control 
            at its core and it also is evolving. I remember asking former UN Secretary-General 
            Boutros-Boutros Ghali what he meant by "change" and he told me that 
            he was introducing "constant change" as a way to continue the evolutionary 
            processes begun in Rio. </font></span>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Under the evolutionary process 
            which Agenda 21 set in motion, sustainable development has become 
            like a prism. Every time you turn it, you get a different "color." 
            The sustainable development prism includes the social, political, 
            economic and environmental factors. Until Rio, the phrase sustainable 
            development had not appeared in any prior UN documents, papers or 
            reference books. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">It should be noted that Agenda 
            21 sets up the global infrastructure needed to manage, count, and 
            control all of the world's assets. Included are the forests, fresh 
            water, agricultural lands, deserts, pastures, rangelands, farmers' 
            fields, oceans and inland waterways, marine environment, marine life, 
            cities, housing, sewer and solid wastes, methods of production, air, 
            pollution, biotechnology-every aspect of living-farming, production 
            and manufacturing, research and medicine, etc., along with you and 
            I. Today everything is sustainable: sustainable water, sustainable 
            forests, sustainable markets, sustainable agriculture, etc. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Through advanced technology such 
            as the Geographic Information System (GIS), the control, count and 
            management of the earth's assets is being implemented. Scientists 
            have told me that the GIS satellites can measure the quality of soil 
            anywhere in the earth to a depth of three inches. Furthermore, it 
            can tell you what kind of birds and insects are in which kind of tree. 
            It can also see you and me sleeping in our beds and living in our 
            houses-ever wonder why leaded paint was such a problem? The UN calls 
            this transparency while you and I call it invasion of privacy.</font>

          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">So how did the UN come up with 
            this heinous agenda? It began in 1972 when the first Earth Summit 
            was held in Stockholm, Sweden. Maurice Strong was the conference Secretary-General 
            of that meeting also. As a result of its deliberations, in 1974 the 
            UN General Assembly set up the UN Environment Program-UNEP, now a 
            major player in sustainable development, interacting with corporations 
            and a key partner in the United Nations Global Compact. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">It should be noted that hundreds, 
            if not thousands of environmental NGO's support and are helping to 
            implement Agenda 21 worldwide. The United Nations has given them vast 
            responsibilities to assist in the implementation of sustainable development. 
            Furthermore, governments are recognizing their manpower as a free 
            source of power to carry the message throughout the world. Two very 
            powerful NGO's that were part of the birthing of sustainable development 
            are the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural 
            Resources (IUCN) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). In the fall of 
            1983, the 38th Session of the United Nations General Assembly passed 
            Resolution 38/161, which called upon the secretary-general to appoint 
            a commission "to propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving 
            sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond." </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The individuals chosen for that 
            commission included Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of 
            Norway and vice-president of the Socialist International who just 
            retired as Director-General of the World Health Organization. It was 
            William Ruckleshaus from the U.S. who also served on this life-changing 
            commission. The rest of the delegates were from other socialist, Marxist, 
            or communist countries. While I could provide you with their definition 
            of sustainable development which my research shows is based on the 
            1977 USSR constitution, let me paraphrase: </font>
        </p></div>
      </div><font size="4">
      </font><blockquote> 
        <div align="center"> 
          <div> 
            <div align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The world has too many people, 
              and if we do not reduce the number of people on planet Earth, they 
              will use up all of the Earth's resources so that future generations 
              will be left without any resources. The United Nations is the best 
              global body to monitor, manage and preserve the resources of the 
              planet. </font></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </blockquote><font size="4">
      </font><div align="center"> 
        <div> 
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">As a community activist ten years 
            ago, I could not understand why our kids were being pushed to use 
            condoms, why the schools were educating in matters that did not involve 
            them, why family planning classes were discussing sensitive matters 
            in front of boys and girls or why homosexuality was becoming accepted 
            (homosexuals don't procreate-now they only adopt). Furthermore, the 
            schools were assisting abortion clinics by aiding pregnant girls during 
            school hours by providing school time for them to use their facilities, 
            without parental consent. These are all methods to reduce the population. 
            Euthanasia, the right to die with dignity, is for the elderly. Then 
            there are wars, illnesses, and viruses. It should be noted that these 
            same environmentalists feel that the population of the world has to 
            be reduced by at least 66% in order for the earth to be sustainable. 
            However, the brilliant research of Dr. Jacqueline Kasun from Hamboldt 
            University has proven statistically that if you were to take all of 
            the people in the world and put them into the State of Texas, they 
            would have 1200 square feet of space each. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Even before the people of the world 
            understood the threat to the world population, the Group of Seven, now 
            the Group of Eight world leaders stated in their 1981 communique that 
            they were "deeply concerned about the implication of world population 
            growth." In 1990, they commended the forthcoming 1992 Rio Earth Summit 
            and in 1992, they wrote, "The Earth Summit has been a landmark in 
            heightening the consciousness of the global environmental challenges 
            and in creating a world-wide partnership on the development and the environment." 
            </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">It was at the 1992 UNCED conference 
            that sustainable development was unveiled. Interestingly to note, 
            there was a very strong and powerful corporate lobby that had come 
            together to support this evil agenda of control. Called the World 
            Business Council for Sustainable Development-WBCSD, they still exert 
            great power and influence on the international level. The WBCSD has 
            nurtured and expanded sustainable development-all the way to the ten 
            year follow-up of UNCED in 2004 at the World Summit for Sustainable 
            Development in Johannesburg. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">In Johannesburg, sustainable development 
            evolved to a much higher level. There many of the same people who 
            were involved ten years previous were present, along with some new 
            players which included Congressman Dennis Kuchinich and others, along 
            with the former governor of California Jerry Brown. The Bush Administration 
            put forth a World Summit Vision Statement that said in part </font>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">To fulfil its commitment, our 
            government is spending $970 million over three years which will be 
            used to leverage private monies to generate more than $1.6B for water-related 
            and other activities globally. Projects included: Clean Energy, an 
            Initiative to Cut Hunger, sustainable forest management and monies 
            to help fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">The centrepiece of Johannesburg 
            was the launching of the "International Sustainable Development Law" that 
            will govern the implementation and legal rights of sustainable development. 
            This new discipline is based on poverty alleviation and the rights 
            of the marginalized (socialistic transfer of wealth mechanisms). Over 
            150 environmental lawyers and those from other related disciplines 
            met in Durban, South Africa a week before to discuss the integration 
            of environmental, economic, and social laws into one new discipline. 
            There were policy papers put forth which they hoped would be used 
            as the framework for a Treaty on International Sustainable Development 
            Law. Their actions reaffirmed Chapter 39 of Agenda 21 which recognizes 
            the need to continue progressive development and codification of international 
            law related to sustainable development. It should be noted that these 
            laws will be incorporated into every local and national level of law 
            worldwide. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">For those of us with Christian 
            values, this is the anti-thesis of what we believe for sustainable 
            development is pagan. It perverts Genesis 1, 2, and 3 in that it puts 
            the earth as being dominant over man and not man as having dominance 
            over the earth-hence, you and I have no value since we have been demoted 
            to the same value as an animal or plant. So what do you think is the 
            end result of international sustainable development law? Enslavement. 
            </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Now who were <b>THE</b> players 
            behind the birthing of sustainable development? To my surprise, it 
            was Prince Charles. Not happy with the Christian faith, Charles turned 
            to "para- psychology" which some define as "dabbling in the occult." 
            He was greatly influenced by the South African-born writer, explorer, 
            and mystic Laurens van der Post who was a friend of his grandmother, 
            the Queen Mother. The prince was also influenced by James Lovelock, 
            a British scientist who formulated the "Gaia hypothesis, which today 
            is known as the worship of the earth, a belief based on the Greek 
            goddess Gaia, the Earth Mother. Charles concurs with the perversion 
            of Genesis 1, 2, and 3. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Most people will not find Prince 
            Charles or his environmental activities in the headlines of major 
            newspapers. Nor do his biographies really explain his involvement, 
            as there is basically a blackout on what he is really doing worldwide. 
            In April 1991, fourteen months before UNCED, the Prince held a private 
            two day international conference aboard the royal yacht Britannia, 
            moored off the coast of Brazil. His goal was to bring together key 
            international figures in an attempt to achieve a degree of harmony 
            between the various countries that would happen at the Rio Earth Summit. 
            Then Senator Al Gore was present, along with senior officials from 
            the World Bank, chief executives from companies such as Shell and 
            British Petroleum, the key NGO's, and other officials. </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">Several years ago, I had the opportunity 
            to interview Maurice Strong and specifically asked him about this 
            meeting. He told me he was in London at a World Wildlife meeting hosted 
            by Prince Philip and was asked by Prince Charles to accompany him 
            to Rio for the April 1991 meeting. Furthermore, in 1990 when sustainable 
            development had just been formulated by the Brundtland Commission, 
            it was the prince who commended them for "bringing the term 'sustainable 
            development' into everyone's vocabulary." </font>
          </p><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Georgia">As sustainable development has 
            evolved to the point where the teaching of Agenda 21 is called "Earth 
            Sciences" in schools, universities, and colleges, our government has 
            instituted Agenda 21 through the Presidents Commission on Sustainable 
            Development. Throughout the U.S., there are cities that have adopted 
            Agenda 21 and there are those that are now sustainable, such as "Sustainable 
            Racine." We must remember Russia did not fall to the communists all 
            at once-it was city by city. </font>

            in 1998 and 2000. It is key and relevant for those who want to understand 
            what is happening today. At every turn the Prince is still involved 
            in the affairs of the United Nations, sustainable development, and 
            public-private partnership. The Prince's representatives are to be 
            found at all the key global meetings, expounding and advancing this 
            life changing philosophy. Perhaps we should wonder why the world still
